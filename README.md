# molar-mass-calculator

This molar mass calculator calculates the molecular weight of a given input formula. Type the formula in the 'formula' field and hit enter or the submit button to calculate the mass of the input formula. 

* Make sure to use the right capatalization for chemical elements: The first letter is always uppercase and a possible second letter is always lowercase (see examples).
* Parantheses are supported. (e.g. (NH4)2CO3) 
* The charge of an ion is not necessary and will return an error when included.

Examples of correct formula notations are:
H2O, CO2, BaO, FeCl2, C6H12O6, Ca(OH)2 and (NH4)2CO3
